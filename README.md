# minitor
Minitor is a lightweight web status monitor for distributed systems.

It receives status updates from other systems or components, and broadcasts information to connected web browsers in real time.

Status updates are sent via HTTP  using simple and standard tools (e.g. curl, PowerShell, wget) or from any programing language.

Setup and configuration are not required.
